title: Simplified JavaScript Jargon
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Simplified JavaScript Jargon (short SJSJ) is a community-driven attempt
  at explaining the loads of buzzwords making the current JavaScript ecosystem
  in a few simple words. The idea is not to replace individual documentations,
  but to act as some kind of glossary that can be easily referenced.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
