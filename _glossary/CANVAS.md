# Canvas

The [Canvas HTML-Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) allows access to individual pixels to enable fast drawing applications.

Its API gives access to [WebGL](/_glossary/WEBGL.md) for 3D graphics and to the [2D drawing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
