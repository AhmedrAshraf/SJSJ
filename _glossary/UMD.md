# UMD

[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) is a pattern of universal module definition for JavaScript modules. These modules are capable of working everywhere, be it in the client, on the server or elsewhere.

The UMD pattern typically attempts to offer compatibility with the most popular script loaders of the day (e.g [RequireJS](/_glossary/REQUIREJS.md) amongst others). In many cases it uses [AMD](/_glossary/AMD.md) as a base, with special-casing added to handle [CommonJS](/_glossary/COMMONJS.md) compatibility.
