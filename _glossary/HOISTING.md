# Hoisting

[“Hoisting”](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting.html) is an action performed by the JavaScript interpreter that moves function declarations of the form `function foo() {}`, and variable declarations of the form `var foo;` to the top of their containing scope. During this process, only the actual declarations are moved; any value assignments are left in the place where they were written.
