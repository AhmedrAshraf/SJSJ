# Jest

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a unit testing framework.

* **Easy setup**: Complete and easy to set-up JavaScript testing solution. Works out of the box for any React project.
* **Instant feedback**: Fast interactive watch mode runs only test files related to changed files and is optimized to give signal quickly.
* **Snapshot testing**: Capture snapshots of React trees or other serializable values to simplify testing and to analyze how state changes over time.

## Philosophies

One of Jest’s philosophies is to provide an integrated “zero-configuration” experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy codebases.
