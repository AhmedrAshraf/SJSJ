# date-fns

[date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) is a JavaScript date utility library. It supports the manipulation, formatting and calculation of dates.

The project currently supports more than 30 languages (https://date-fns.org/v1.29.0/docs/I18n).

date-fns is also designed to be lightweight due to its function-per-file style, which allow developers to pick only the functions they require. This prevents the project from being bloated with redundant functions.
