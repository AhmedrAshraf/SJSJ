# Mocha

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is an extensible, open-source JavaScript testing framework that runs in [Node.js](/_glossary/NODEJS.md) or the browser. It supports both TDD and BDD by allowing you to use any assertion library, such as [expect.js](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js), [should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js), and [Chai](/_glossary/CHAI.md).

Mocha supports spies, stubs and mocks through libraries, such as [Sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon).

Mocha supports testing both synchronous and asynchronous code, including [promises](http://www.sitepoint.com/promises-in-javascript-unit-tests-the-definitive-guide/).
