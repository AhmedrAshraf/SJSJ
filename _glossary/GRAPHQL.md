# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## Advantge over REST

1. Ask for exactly what you need - GraphQL queries returns exactly what you need. No redundant data will be sent over.
2. Get multiple resources in a single HTTP Request - GraphQL queries are able to identify references between multiple resources. This optimizes the network performance of applications using GraphQL

## Popular GraphQL Tools

1. [Apollo Client] (https://www.apollographql.com/)
