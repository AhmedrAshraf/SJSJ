# Ionic

[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is a HTML5 mobile framework to build beautiful hybrid native mobile applications using AngularJS and Cordova. It comes accompanied with a powerful CLI to create, build, test and deploy your applications into any platform. The framework also offers live reloading features to apply live changes to the application. 

With the advent of Angular 2, the Ionic team have started working on [Ionic 2](http://ionic.io/2), which is a complete rewrite of Ionic.
