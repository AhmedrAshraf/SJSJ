# V8

[V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) is Google’s open source, high performance JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome and other projects.

V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs.

Check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki) for more information.
