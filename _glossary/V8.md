# V8

[V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) is Googleâ€™s open source, high performance JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome and other projects.

V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs.
