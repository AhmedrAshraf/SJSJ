# nvm

[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown) is a utility to help run multiple versions of [Node.js](/glossary/NODEJS.md) (and its branches) on the same machine. It can install, list, and choose versions. It is analogous to [RVM](https://rvm.io/) (Ruby Version Manager).
