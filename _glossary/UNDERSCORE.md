# Underscore

[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) is a small library which provides many helpers to write JavaScript in a more functional way without extending built-in prototypes. It may be seen as the swiss army knife of JavaScript development, as it provides a helper for most API shortcomings of built-in objects.
