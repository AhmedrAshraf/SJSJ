# JSON

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://www.json.org/) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is widely used in [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web services. It is both easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.
