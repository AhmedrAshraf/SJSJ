# JSCS

[JSCS — JavaScript Code Style](http://jscs.info/) is different from the others in that it doesn’t do anything unless you give it a configuration file or tell it to use a preset. You can download configurations from their website, so it’s not a big problem, and it has a number of presets, such as the [jQuery](/glossary/JQUERY.md) coding style preset and the Google preset. JSCS is a code style checker. This means it only catches issues related to code formatting, and not potential bugs or errors.
