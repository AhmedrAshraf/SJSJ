# AJAX

[AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) is a technique for creating seamless interactive websites via asynchronous data exchange between client and server. AJAX facilitates communication with the server via partial page updates instead of the traditional full-page refresh.
