# JSHint

[JSHint](http://jshint.com/) was created as a more configurable version of [JSLint](/glossary/JSLINT.md) (of which it is a fork). You can configure every rule, and put them into a configuration file, which makes JSHint easy to use in bigger projects. JSHint also has good documentation for each of the rules, so you know exactly what they do.
