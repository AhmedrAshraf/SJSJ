# Meteor

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) Meteor is JS framework written using node.js. It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publishâ€“subscribe pattern to enable automatic synching of data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code. 

PS: Meteor is to Node as Rails is to Ruby
