# Chai

[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) / Test Driven Development (TDD) assertion library for [Node.js](NODEJS.md) and the browser. It can be paired with any JavaScript testing framework, such as [Mocha](MOCHA.md).

The Chai assertion library allows you to write assertions in the classical form: `assert.typeOf(foo, 'string')`, but where Chai shines is its chain-capable style which makes writing assertions very readable: `expect(foo).to.be.a('string')`.
