# Lodash

[Lodash](https://lodash.com) is a small [modulized](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized) library which provides bunch of helpers to work with array, string,... much simpler. Every single helper can be required and used itself without requiring the whole library. Additional, it makes Javascript code look elegant and more efficient by offering functional style, method chaining and [more](https://lodash.com/#features).

It may be seen as alternative of [Underscore](UNDERSCORE.md).
